# shorty

##
The URL shortener app is a MERN stack application and was deployed on Heroku. The data is stored on MongoDB, with React as the front-end, Node as the backend, and styled with Sass.
The app allows the user to shorten their long URL link by replacing the length of a new link with random 6 characters. The user is able to copy the new link which functions in the same manner as the original URL.
